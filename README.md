Full-stack web application with authorization capability, implementation of two roles (user, administrator). User can search and listen to tracks, create playlists. Administrator extends the functionality of the user, being able to add albums, tracks and artists.

The application is deployed on Vercel. Unfortunately, due to Vercel storage limitation (EROFS), it is not possible to perform Create and Update operations with files.
